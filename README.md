# IBM_recommendations
Building a recommendation engine for IBM users to help choose relevant &amp; exciting new articles to read

### Intro
The goal of this project was to create a recommendation system that is able to reccomend articles to IBM users. This was accomplished using a variety of reccomendation strategies, such as content based filtering, collaberative filtering, and knowledge based filtering

### Get Started
All you'll need to get started is the Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb file. This contains all the code used to create the recommendation engine, and you will be able to see everything you need from here. The other files are mainly used to test that my code was working in various locations, so you can pretty much ignore those as long as you don't run the cells that have code checks in them.

### Files
* <u>Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb</u>: Notebook used to build recommendation system. This will walk you through the process of creating the recommendation system from start to finish
* <u>Recommendations_with_IBM.html</u>: HTML file of the jupyter notebook
* <u>project_tests.py</u>: File used to test that our code was working well at different stages in the notebook. Not necessary to build the recommendation engine
* <u>top_10.p</u>: Used to check solution
* <u>top_20.p</u>: Used to check solution
* <u>top_5.p</u>: Used to check solution
